# DAY 1 [30 July 2025]
### I had been looking forward to this day with great excitement — it was my first day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC). The morning began with a spiritual session of kirtan at the Gurdwara Sahib around 8:30 AM. It brought a peaceful and uplifting start to the day. After that, we were served refreshments including tea and snacks, which created a friendly atmosphere to interact and feel at ease.

Later, we gathered in the auditorium for a welcome speech by our esteemed Principal Sir. He spoke about the significance of discipline, dedication, and enthusiasm in building a successful and meaningful future. I was amazed to find out that the college was founded in 1956 and is now marking its 70th year — a proud and historic moment for everyone associated with GNDEC.

We also heard from a guest speaker, who shared how engineering goes beyond machines and coding — it’s about using creativity and courage to solve real-life challenges. His words truly changed the way I see this field.

During the day, I got a chance to interact with some of my new batchmates. Although we were unfamiliar with each other in the morning, by the end of the session, we had already started forming a connection.

I feel that the college is making a genuine effort to offer us the best facilities and kind, encouraging mentors. It filled me with pride and happiness to become part of such a respected institution.

Since the college is committed to supporting us, we must also commit ourselves to being dedicated learners and responsible citizens. This attitude will not only help us succeed personally but also improve the quality of life in the society we live in.

I’m genuinely excited to begin this new chapter in such an inspiring environment.

# DAY 2 [1 AUGUST 2025]
### On the second day of our orientation program at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), we had the opportunity to participate in a deeply insightful and thought-provoking session on Universal Human Values (UHV), conducted by Dr. Priya Darshini Madam. The session encouraged us to reflect on important aspects of our lives that we often overlook in our daily routines. She emphasized the significance of living with intention, understanding who we truly are, and maintaining harmonious and meaningful relationships with those around us. Her words inspired us to think beyond academics and to focus on building a life rooted in values, self-awareness, and emotional well-being.

Following this enlightening session, we attended another engaging and impactful workshop led by Dr. Arvind Dhingra Sir, who spoke on the topic of personality development. His talk was centered around how we, as young students stepping into professional education, can gradually transform into confident, responsible, and well-rounded individuals. He discussed the importance of self-confidence, clear communication, emotional intelligence, and the ability to adapt to various situations in life.

What made Dr. Dhingra Sir’s session particularly enjoyable was the way he kept it interactive and energetic. Instead of just giving a lecture, he involved us in a variety of games, group tasks, and fun-filled activities that not only kept us engaged but also helped us understand the importance of collaboration, trust, effective communication, and self-reflection. Through these simple yet powerful activities, we were able to connect with each other and gain new insights about ourselves.

By the end of the day, I felt that the experiences had been both enjoyable and deeply motivating. We were able to learn a lot in a way that didn’t feel like formal learning. The sessions helped us grow not just as students, but as individuals who aspire to become thoughtful, ethical, and capable members of society. It truly was a day where learning met joy, and where values met personal growth.

# DAY 3 [ 4 AUGUST 2025]
### The third day of the Induction Program at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) was both informative and engaging, offering a balance of personal growth and academic learning.

The day began with an introduction to the Causmic Club, where we were briefed about the club's purpose, objectives, and the various activities it organizes throughout the academic year. The club aims to promote innovation, creativity, and technical excellence among students through workshops, competitions, and group projects. It was inspiring to see how such platforms are designed to nurture talent and encourage active student participation beyond the classroom.

Following this, we attended a session on Universal Human Values (UHV) led by Dr. Priya Darshini Madam. The session guided us to reflect deeply on topics like mental clarity, emotional balance, and a sense of personal responsibility. She emphasized that aligning our ambitions with a meaningful purpose helps us grow into not only competent professionals but also ethical and compassionate individuals. Her message reinforced the idea that being a good human being is the first step toward becoming a successful engineer.

After this enriching session, we moved on to our C++ programming class, where we were introduced to basic input and output operations using cin and cout. We wrote a simple program to display our name using cout, which helped us grasp the basic syntax and structure of a C++ program. This hands-on practice session ignited our interest in coding and logical thinking, laying the foundation for future programming skills.

In the latter part of the day, we attended our Physics class, where the focus was on essential concepts such as motion and measurement. The instructor explained how these basic principles are deeply connected to real-world applications in engineering fields. This approach helped us understand how Physics serves as a core subject across all branches of engineering, making it more relevant and easier to relate to.

Overall, Day 3 was an enriching experience, combining value-based education with foundational technical learning. It helped us grow both intellectually and personally, making the day both productive and inspiring.

# DAY 4 [5 AUGUST 2025]
### Today at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), we assembled in the auditorium for a highly informative and thought-provoking session on Millets – The Super Food. The resource person shared valuable insights into how millets are a powerhouse of nutrition, loaded with essential elements like dietary fiber, iron, calcium, and other vital micronutrients. What makes millets even more impressive is their eco-friendly nature, as they require significantly less water and fewer chemical inputs compared to other cereal crops, making them ideal for sustainable farming.

During the session, we explored the importance of millets in promoting better health, preventing lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart conditions, and their ability to enhance overall well-being. The speaker emphasized how these ancient grains, once a staple in traditional Indian diets, are now regaining importance on a global scale due to their health and environmental benefits.

Various ways of incorporating millets into daily meals—like making rotis, idlis, dosas, and even snacks—were also discussed. It was truly enlightening to realize how these humble grains can play a crucial role in shaping a healthier, more sustainable future. The session encouraged us to rethink our eating habits and embrace millet-based diets as part of modern nutrition and environmental responsibility.
